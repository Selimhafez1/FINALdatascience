### Correct Predictions 

H â†’ H: 3340 times the match was a Home win, and the model correctly predicted Home win.

D â†’ D: 124 times the match was a Draw, and the model correctly predicted Draw.

A â†’ A: 1105 times the match was an Away win, and the model correctly predicted Away win.

__________________________________________________________________________________________

### Incorrect Predictions for Home wins

H â†’ D: 163 times the model predicted Draw, but the actual result was a Home win.

H â†’ A: 671 times the model predicted Away win, but it was actually a Home win.

__________________________________________________________________________________________

### Incorrect Predictions for Draws

D â†’ H: 1669 times the model predicted Home win, but the actual result was a Draw.

D â†’ A: 588 times the model predicted Away win, but the actual result was a Draw.

__________________________________________________________________________________________

### Incorrect Predictions for Away wins

A â†’ H: 1365 times the model predicted Home win, but it was actually an Away win.

A â†’ D: 115 times the model predicted Draw, but it was actually an Away win.

__________________________________________________________________________________________

1. Home wins are the most biased result from the model, and this is due to the fact that the real-life results reflect that home wins are the most common result.
2. Draws are mostly predicted as home wins, which is a downside of the model because it rarely considers draws.
